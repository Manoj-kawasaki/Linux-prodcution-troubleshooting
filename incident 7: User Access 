Incident 7: User Access Failure — Linux Troubleshooting Lab

# Overview

- This lab simulates a real-world Linux incident where a developer is locked out of administrative access. The objective is to diagnose the root cause and safely restore access using proper Linux user and group management practices.

- This scenario reflects common DevOps/SRE incidents involving SSH access and privilege recovery.

---

# Objective

- Simulate developer lockout
- Diagnose permission issues
- Restore sudo access safely
- Validate user authentication
- Implement secure access practices

---

# Scenario

A developer account exists but cannot execute administrative commands.

Attempting sudo results in:

devuser is not in the sudoers file

This indicates missing privilege assignment.

---

- Step 1: Investigation

Check user group membership:

groups devuser

Output confirms the user is not part of the sudo group.

---

# Root Cause

The developer account lacks membership in the administrative group required for elevated privileges.

Linux access control depends on:

- User identity
- Group membership
- Permission inheritance

---

- Step 2: Resolution

Add the user to the sudo group:

sudo usermod -aG sudo devuser

Verify:

- groups devuser

Switch user and test:

- su - devuser
sudo ls

Administrative access is restored.

---

- Step 3: SSH Key-Based Authentication

Generate SSH key:

- ssh-keygen

Copy to user:

- ssh-copy-id devuser@localhost

Test passwordless login:

- ssh devuser@localhost

---

# Verification

- User regains sudo access
- Group membership updated
- SSH login validated
- Administrative functionality restored

---

# Key Learnings

- Linux user/group access model
- sudo privilege management
- SSH authentication workflow
- Secure access restoration
- Structured incident troubleshooting

---

# Professional Summary
