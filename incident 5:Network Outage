# Linux Troubleshooting Lab — Incident 5: Network Outage

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate and resolve a real-world Linux network outage where an application becomes unreachable due to blocked ports or DNS issues. This incident focuses on structured network troubleshooting using industry-standard tools.


## 🛠 Scenario

A local web service was running but became inaccessible from the system. The goal was to diagnose whether the issue was caused by:

- Blocked ports
- Firewall rules
- Service listening failures
- DNS or routing problems


## 🔍 Investigation Steps

### 1. Verify Service Status

Check if the service is running and listening:


- ss -tuln


Confirmed whether the application was bound to port 8080.


## 2. Test Connectivity

Attempt connection to the service:


curl http://localhost:8080

This validated whether the application responded correctly.


### 3. Check Firewall Rules

Inspect firewall status:


sudo ufw status

Detected blocked or restricted ports.


### 4. Trace Network Path

Diagnose routing issues:

bash
traceroute localhost

Verified packet flow and network reachability.


## ✅ Resolution

Allowed traffic through the firewall:


sudo ufw allow 8080


Re-tested connectivity:


curl http://localhost:8080


The service responded successfully.



# Verification

- Confirmed port accessibility
- Verified firewall rules
- Validated successful HTTP response


# 📘 Key Learnings

- Use `ss` to confirm open ports
- Use `curl` to test application response
- Use `ufw` to manage firewall access
- Use `traceroute` to debug routing issues
- Always verify fixes after remediation
