# 🚀 Automated Server Health Monitor (Linux | Cron | Bash)

## 📌 Project Overview

In real production environments, engineers do not manually log in to servers to check CPU, memory, disk usage, or service health.

Monitoring must be:

- Automated
- Continuous
- Alert-driven

This project simulates a real-world DevOps/SRE scenario by building a **Server Health Monitoring & Alerting system using Bash and Cron**.

It automatically checks:

- Disk usage
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Service status

and generates alerts in a log file when thresholds are crossed.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design a lightweight monitoring solution that:

- Runs automatically
- Detects system resource issues
- Logs alerts with clear messages
- Mimics real production monitoring behaviour

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Linux (Ubuntu / WSL)
- Bash scripting
- Cron (job scheduler)
- System monitoring commands

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Script Execution

The script collects system metrics using:

- `df` → Disk usage
- `top` → CPU usage
- `free` → Memory usage
- `systemctl` → Service health

### 2️⃣ Threshold Check

Each resource is compared against a predefined limit.

Example:

- Disk > 90%

If the threshold is crossed → an alert is generated.

---

### 3️⃣ Alert Logging

Alerts are written to:


#health.log


This simulates how monitoring tools send:

- Logs
- Notifications
- Alerts

in production systems.

---

### 4️⃣ Full Automation with Cron

The script is scheduled using:

crontab -e

Runs automatically every minute:
# hr min day mont weekdays
/home/rolex/server-health-monitor/monitor.sh


This removes manual health checks completely.

---

## 🧪 Alert Testing (Production-Style Validation)

Instead of actually filling the disk (unsafe in real systems), alert testing was performed by:

- Temporarily lowering threshold values
- Running the script
- Verifying alert generation in real time

This follows the **same safe alert validation strategy used in production environments**.

✔ Disk usage check  
✔ Script execution  
✔ Automated alert in log  

These demonstrate:

- Monitoring logic
- Automation
- Real validation

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Monitoring must be automated, not manual
- Cron is the backbone of Linux job automation
- Alert validation should be safe and controlled
- Logs act as the first level of observability
- Small scripts can simulate real SRE systems

---

## 💼 Real-World Relevance

This project reflects how:

- DevOps engineers implement lightweight health checks
- SRE teams validate alerting systems
- Production servers are monitored continuously

This is the **foundation of tools like:**

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- CloudWatch

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Email alerts
- Slack/Webhook integration
- Timestamped logs
- Docker container monitoring
- Multiple server monitoring

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

✔ Automation mindset  
✔ Linux operational skills  
✔ Monitoring & alerting fundamentals  
✔ Production-style validation approach
