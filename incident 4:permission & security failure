 Permission & Security Failure
# objective
- Simulate a real-world Linux permission failure where an application cannot access its own log file. Investigate the issue using Linux ownership and permission concepts and resolve it using a safe, production-style troubleshooting approach.
- This incident focuses on:
- File ownership
- User permissions
- Secure access validation
- Minimal-risk remediation
# Environment Setup
- A test application directory and log file were created
- sudo mkdir -p /opt/app/data
- sudo touch /opt/app/data/app.log
- Checking file ownership:
ls -l /opt/app/data/app.log
- Example output:
-rw------- 1 root root app.log
The file is owned by root, simulating a scenario where the application user cannot access its own log.

# Problem Simulation
- Attempting to write to the file as the application user:
- sudo -u appuser echo "Test log" >> /opt/app/data/app.log
- Output:
Permission denied
This confirms the application user lacks sufficient permissions.

# Investigation
- We inspected file ownership and permissions:
- ls -l /opt/app/data/
- Findings:
- File owned by root
- Application runs as appuser
- appuser has no read/write access

# Root Cause
- The log file was created by root with restrictive permissions. The application runs under a separate service account (appuser), causing a permission mismatch.
# Resolution
- We corrected ownership to match the application runtime user:
- sudo chown appuser:appuser /opt/app/data/app.log
- This ensures the application user has proper access while maintaining secure ownership.
- We then verified access:
- sudo -u appuser cat /opt/app/data/app.log
- The file was successfully accessed.
# Verification
- Final validation steps:
- ls -l /opt/app/data/app.log
- sudo -u appuser cat /opt/app/data/app.log
No permission errors occurred, confirming the issue is resolved.

# Key Learnings
- Linux file access depends on ownership and permissions
- Applications run under dedicated service accounts
- Ownership mismatches cause real production failures
- Use sudo -u to simulate application behavior
- Always investigate before changing permissions

# Security Note
In production environments, permissions should follow the principle of least privilege. Ownership should match the application user without granting unnecessary access.

# Professional Summary
